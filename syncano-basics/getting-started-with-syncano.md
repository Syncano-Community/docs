Once you have clicked on the activation url, you'll be redirected to Admin Dashboard. Here is where all of your *instances* will be. You can think of instances as projects. When creating a new instance you are creating a new project in Syncano. You can create a new instance by following the steps in the image below.

When accessing an instance in the Syncano API, you can use API Keys that belong to that instance. You can find them by clicking on the instance, and then clicking the API keys selection as shown in the picture below. Here, you can add new API keys to that instance as well as view all existing keys. 

When trying to connect to an instance with one of our libraries, the API key is passed as a parameter and serves as the password for connecting to your instance. There is more on that right ahead.

Once you have your API Key, you can connect from the library of your choice:
[block:code]
{
  "codes": [
    {
      "code": "# In cURL, you have to pass API Key with every call you make, so e.g. to list instances associated with API Key, you can use\n\ncurl -X GET \\\n-H \"X-API-KEY: <API_KEY>\" \\\n\"https://api.syncano.io/v1.1/instances/\"",
      "language": "curl"
    },
    {
      "code": "import syncano\nsyncano.connect(api_key='API_KEY')\n\n# returns a registry object. ",
      "language": "python"
    },
    {
      "code": "var Syncano = require('syncano'); //Common JS only\nvar syncano = new Syncano({apiKey:'API_KEY', instance:'INSTANCE_NAME'});\n",
      "language": "javascript"
    },
    {
      "code": "new SyncanoBuilder().apiKey(\"YOUR API KEY\").instanceName(\"YOUR INSTANCE\")\n     .androidContext(context).setAsGlobalInstance(true).build();",
      "language": "java",
      "name": "Android"
    },
    {
      "code": "#import <Syncano.h>\n//...\nSyncano *myInstance = [Syncano sharedInstanceWithApiKey:@\"YOUR_API_KEY\" instanceName:@\"INSTANCE_NAME\"];\n// interact with your Instance!",
      "language": "objectivec"
    },
    {
      "code": "//in bridging header\n#import <Syncano.h>\n\n//in your class file\nlet myInstance = Syncano.sharedInstanceWithApiKey(\"YOUR_API_KEY\", instanceName: \"INSTANCE_NAME\")\n// interact with your Instance!",
      "language": "objectivec",
      "name": "Swift"
    },
    {
      "code": "require 'syncano'\n\nconnection = Syncano.connect(api_key: 'YOUR_API_KEY')",
      "language": "ruby"
    }
  ]
