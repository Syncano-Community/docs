What if that specific feature youâ€™re working on has already been built by someone else? What if you could use the Car class written by your colleague or use a Twitter integration created by a more experienced coder?

There's a lot of code redundancy out there and that's why we present Solutions!

We want developers to create their own app templates and then take it one step further - export them and share them with others. Within Syncano, developers essentially are able to have a canvas of their own work and share it for use amongst the community.

A Solution can be as simple as a Snippet Script that [sends SMS messages](https://dashboard.syncano.io/#/solutions/9/edit) or as complex as a set of Classes (along with sample Data Objects) and CodeBoxes needed to [store & query a set of geographic locations](https://dashboard.syncano.io/#/solutions/27/edit).

To put it simply,  Solutions can dramatically speed up the development process allowing you to easily install code blocks you need for your app instead of wasting time creating code that's already been written.

# Find Solution for your App

You can filter Solutions based on what you're looking for. If you're a fan of Python and are looking for an image processing integration - choose "python" and "image" from the tag list on the left.

And that's it! Depending on a Solution you might need to modify a few things (add your own API Keys or 3rd party integration credentials) but you're mostly ready to go and wow the world with your new app!
