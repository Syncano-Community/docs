### What is Syncano?

Syncano is a backend platform to build powerful real-time apps more efficiently.

Syncano gives you the freedom to integrate with any API, define your data schema, write sophisticated processes to run any code in the cloud - on a Schedule, Trigger Sockets and Script Endpoints and share app functionality in our open source community of Solutions - all from one intuitive dashboard.

Our goal is to help you solve real user experience problems so that you don't have to worry about wasting time on CRUD operations and other plumbing activities.

***

### What capabilities does Syncano provide to simplify application development?

- With Syncano, any front-end developer can set up their entire backend, middleware, infrastructure and more without writing backend code
- Minimize boilerplate backend code with Solutions. Solutions are pieces of backend functionality to help reduce a lot of code redundancy. There is a lot of code that must reused for many different applications - but why would it make sense to rebuild the same functionality over and over again? Solutions help solve this problem for you. Browse through our directory of Solutions, create and share your own. All you need to do is hit the "Install" button, select your instance, and you have pre-made functionality installed into your app.
- Scripts give you the ability to write and run any code on Syncano. A Script is an object that contains a script that can be run on Syncano's code servers - think of it as a microservice-like functionality. Script can be run in several different ways - all depending on your apps' needs. 
- Code with your preferred language. Use or REST API or our libraries. We currently support iOS (Swift and ObjC), Android, Javascript, Python and Ruby. We're always adding more and appreciate your feedback. If we don't have what you need, let us know!
- Define your data schema with Classes. Classes give you the flexibility to customize the data in your app.  Our NoSQL database enables you to create sophisticated data relations.
- Channels enable you to easily add real-time communication to your app.
- With User authentication, you can choose who can access your data by using our Permissions and User management.

### Why should I use Syncano instead of setting up a database and building a customized set of APIs?

Modern developers struggle with rushing to market and are so focused on the core of their app that they have little to no time to focus on the user experience. Developers are left wasting time on CRUD operations instead of what truly matters. 

Additionally, when you create a specialized server and API for your app, then they are only good for that particular app.  When you start developing a new app, you’re back at the beginning.  Syncano eliminates the need for you to create a specialized server and API. You can reuse functionality for any app you build and focus on problems specific to your app instead.

Our goal is to reduce boilerplate code and for any front-end developer to be able to build a fully-fledged app without having to know backend code. We hope to give control back to the developer, to create a platform that gives you the flexibility to build how you want. We believe developers should be spending time focusing on your customers - not on middleware, backend or maintenance issues. 
***

### How often do you release new versions of your platform?

We use agile development methodologies to continuously iterate our platform. For larger releases and substantial product changes, we follow a 6 week release cycle. 

You're most important when it comes to adding new features and making changes, so let us know if you if you have suggestions for new features, improvements or other comments at [support@syncano.com](mailto:support@syncano.com).

***

### When will I be billed?

We want to ensure you have the time you need to test out all of Syncano's features and functionality. Building an app takes time so we built our model on a "pay only once you deploy model." After you create your free Builder account, you will have 6 months to use it and there are certain limits. You have 100,000 free API calls and 1,000 free Script runs per month. 

Once you are ready to switch to production mode or you exceed the limits in the Builder plan, simply log into your dashboard and select "Billing" under "Account." Flip the switch to production and pick your plan based on your needs. Start at $25/month and tweak based on your needs. 

For your first bill, the cost is prorated but the amount of usage is not.  Select your plan, enter your credit card information and you will receive an invoice for the pro-rated amount. After this first pro-rated cycle, your credit card on file will be charged at the beginning of each month. 

If you exceed your paid limits you can always change your plan for the next billing cycle. Overage will appear in the following month's statement. (so overage for September will appear in October's bill). We encourage you to use our dashboard to help predict your usage.

***

### Can Syncano be deployed on premises?

We understand that enterprises may wish to have Syncano on their premises. Get in touch at [hello@syncano.com](mailto:hello@syncano.com) and we'd be happy to discuss your specific enterprise requirements.

***

### How can I move my data off Syncano?

Simply download all your data using our API, or contact us at [support@syncano.com](mailto:support@syncano.com) for assistance. 
 
In the future, our roadmap for Syncano includes support for exporting/importing full instances with their structure and data, all with the ability to share this among users. 

***

### We are interested in partnership opportunities. Who can I talk to?

No problem! Simply send an email to [hello@syncano.com](mailto:hello@syncano.com) with an overview of what you have in mind and we'd love to chat!

### What is an Instance?

A way for you to separate different types of data which have nothing in common between them.

Think of instances as projects or apps. Each time you create a new instance, you are creating a new project in Syncano.

Suppose you want to create two apps: (1) a class schedule for students, so they can organize their time better and (2) an event planner for students so that they know where the most interesting meetups and parties take place. If you decide that the class schedule and events planning data should be kept separate, then you would simply create two instances.

***

### How can I add a new Instance?

Go to your [Syncano Dashboard](https://dashboard.syncano.io/), sign up or log in and click the big “+” button in the bottom right corner. Fill the name text field and click "confirm". 

See our Dev Manual on [Instances](http://docs.syncano.com/docs/getting-started-with-syncano#adding-an-instance) to learn more.

You can also add new Instances through our API - see how to do it [here](http://docs.syncano.com/v0.1.1/docs/instances-add).

***

### What is a Class?

Classes are templates - descriptions - for the data objects you want to store in Syncano. When you want to create an object that has the characteristics (attributes) of a particular class, then you simply instantiate that object. 

 Let’s look at an example.

If the Student class has these attributes:
- name
- date of birth
- place of birth
- height
- properties

and the School class has these:
- city
- patron
- number of classrooms
- students
- properties.

Any Data Object that is an instantiation of one of these classes will inherit the class’s properties and have those custom keys present by default. This means that every Student will have a name, date of birth, place of birth and height. You also have the power to create links between objects belonging to different classes, making development that much easier!

***

### How can I create my own class?

That’s really simple! Just click the “+” sign in the bottom right corner of the “Classes” tab in the Syncano Dashboard, fill out all necessary fields, and click Done!

Want to know more? Check out the Classes section in the Developer Manual [here](doc:classes).

***

### How can I add a new object?

Provided that you have a [Classes](doc:classes) created:
- Go to the Data Browser tab in the [Syncano Dashboard](https://dashboard.syncano.io)
- Select the Class you want to which you want to add the Data Object 
- Click the "+" button in bottom right corner
- Fill in the fields and click confirm

***
### How can I filter my data?

With Syncano you can filter and sort by any field in any class you want to. For example, if you’d like to find Students born in 1995 in New York City, you can easily do that using the Syncano API.

Please see the [Filtering and Ordering Data Objects](doc:data-objects-filtering) chapter in the API Reference section to learn more. If you'd like to set up filtering options via the library of your choice, please refer to the library specific docs.

***

### What is a Script Snippet?

A Script Snippet is a piece of code you can run in the cloud (on Syncano servers). Technology used for the environments created during the code execution is powered by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Go to the [Snippets - Scripts](doc:snippets-scripts) chapter for examples and an in-depth explanation.

***

### What is a Channel?

A channel is the place where notifications are being sent.

You could, for example, define a channel to receive a notification when new Students were added, and a different notification for updates about all Schools.

Syncano Channels allow you to limit and filter the amount of data you receive, so you have to deal only with real-time updates on those objects important for your app, not on every object that exists.

You can read more on Channels in our Developer Manual’s [Realtime communication](doc:realtime-communication) chapter.

***

### How can I get real-time notifications about changes?

For new object additions, object updates or deletion, simply define which events you want to send to which channel. Then, listen to any messages in that channel.

Please see the [Realtime communication](doc:realtime-communication) chapter in the documentation to learn more.

### What happens if I exceed my usage? Can I set limits?

When you log into your Dashboard you can set hard limits (absolute) and soft limits (warnings/notifications issued) so that you are always in the loop when you have a sudden burst in usage. If you actually exceed your usage, your overage will appear on the next month’s bill. You can change your limits at any time.

***

### Help! I don’t know how to predict my usage.

We understand that all apps come in different shapes and sizes. We recommend you start at the $25 plan to determine what your needs are for the first month. You can always adjust your usage for the following month.

***

### What counts as a Script second?

To understand a Script second, let’s look at Script itself. It is a powerful Syncano tool with multiple applications. You can use it to create integrations between third party services, to create your own logic accessible by an API built on Scripts, to run schedules, to create triggers and more. So Script Seconds count for execution of:
 - Script Endpoints
 - Schedule Sockets
 - Trigger Sockets
 - direct Script runs. 
 
So, for example, if you run one Script directly for 5 seconds and one from Script Endpoint for 10 seconds it will give a total of 15 Script seconds.
***

### What are the limits on the Builder plan?

You have access to 100,000 API calls per month and 20,000 Script executions per month - as long as you’re in building mode, it’s on us.

***

### What kind of usage metrics will I have access to?

Usage is accessible in your dashboard. Easily track the amount of API calls and Snippet seconds by going to this [page](https://dashboard.syncano.io/#/account/plan). 

***

### What happens when my Builder plan expires at 6 months?

At the end of the 6 months, you can switch your account to production to continue using all of the functionality the Syncano platform has to offer. But don’t worry, we will make sure you have plenty of advance notice that your plan is about to expire. And you can always contact us with any questions you may have at payments@syncano.com
