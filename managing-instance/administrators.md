**Administrator** accounts are used for accessing the Syncano Admin Panel of your Instance. Each administrator has the following properties:
+ E-mail (required)
+ First and last name (optional)
+ Role

Administrators can perform different tasks based on their roles. Roles allow you to control user access of your application. Each role has different permissions:

        "#1a70ce",

      ]
    }

Until the newly invited administrator registers or accepts the invitation, it will be visible in the Pending Invitations section.

If you changed your mind and you donâ€™t feel like working with the person you just invited, click the Cancel invitation button. The invitation email will still be sent, but the url will expire making it impossible to register/accept.
